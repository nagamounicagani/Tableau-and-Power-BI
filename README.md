This project includes interactive Tableau and Power BI dashboards built using the Global Terrorism dataset. The dashboards highlight key KPIs, trends, and patterns through clear visual storytelling. Users can filter and drill down to explore insights across different categories and time periods. The goal is to turn raw data into actionable insights for faster, data-driven decisions.
